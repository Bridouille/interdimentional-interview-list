# Your super fun tech challenge: "The interdimensional-recyclerview"

### Your challenge:
1) Clone this repository and create a new branch to work on. This will be useful when we do a short peer review exercise :)

2) Using this Rick and Morty API, https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest, we'd like you to display **a list of** your
 choice of Rick and Morty characters using a few specific character properties (such as name, species..) and an image. Only display the characters that have the same status (alive, dead, unknown).

 3) Make a call to the characters endpoint (already provided) and do your filtering on the client side but keep in mind you are not allowed to use the API's build in filtering. Make the filtering before you display the response data however you see fit.

 4) Please feel free to use and modify the prebuilt retrofit interface how every you'd like to.

 5) Lastly, we'd like to see you create a very basic "detail view" allowing you to click on a row of the recyclerview and navigate to a page
 with all that particular rows information, including a nice image at the top. Don't spend too much time on the UI though :)
 
 6) How does that sound? Any questions?
 
 - Note: Please treat us as if we are your coworkers! Ask us questons and use any resources that you can accurately explain!
 - Have fun and good luck :)
